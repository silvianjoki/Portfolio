        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I recently began my journey as a Software Developer. Previously, I have held different roles with the most recent one being as a Business Development Associate (must admit that was interesting). Aside from that, I work and enjoy being an artist. I create pieces using different mediums and have my art pieces really being landscape or abstract.
